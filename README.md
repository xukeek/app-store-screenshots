### NOTE: MAKE SURE TO USE 6.1 INCH simulator to capture starting screenshots
this will save u from adjusting the images later

# App Store Screenshots Generator

A skill for AI-powered coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) that generates production-ready App Store screenshots for iOS apps. It scaffolds a Next.js project, designs advertisement-style screenshots, exports them at all required Apple resolutions, supports localized screenshot sets including Chinese, and can generate localized App Store metadata that fits iOS length limits.

## What it does

- Asks you about your app's brand, features, and style preferences
- Scaffolds a minimal Next.js project (or works within an existing one)
- Designs each screenshot as an **advertisement** — not a UI showcase
- Writes compelling copy using proven App Store copywriting patterns
- Supports multi-locale screenshot copy and export flows (`en-US`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ja-JP`, etc.), with one export directory per locale and side-by-side preview on the page
- Generates App Store marketing metadata per locale: app name, subtitle, promotional text, description, and keywords
- Validates metadata against Apple length limits, including keyword byte limits for CJK locales
- Renders screenshots at full resolution with a built-in iPhone mockup
- Exports PNGs at all 4 Apple-required sizes (6.9", 6.5", 6.3", 6.1")

## Included assets

- `mockup.png` — Pre-measured iPhone frame with transparent screen area

## Install

### Using npx skills (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots
```

This works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenCode, Codex, and [40+ other agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills#available-agents).

Install globally (available across all projects):

```bash
npx skills add ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots -g
```

Install for a specific agent:

```bash
npx skills add ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots -a claude-code
```

### Manual (git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParthJadhav/app-store-screenshots ~/.claude/skills/app-store-screenshots
```

## Usage

Once installed, the skill triggers automatically when you ask Claude Code to:

- Build App Store screenshots
- Generate marketing screenshots for an iOS app
- Create exportable screenshot assets

Or just tell Claude Code what you need:

```
> Build App Store screenshots for my app
```

Claude will ask you about your app's screenshots, brand colors, font, features, style direction, target locales, number of slides, and whether you also want localized App Store metadata before building anything.

## What gets scaffolded

If starting from an empty folder, the skill creates:

```
project/
├── public/
│   ├── mockup.png          # iPhone frame (copied from skill)
│   ├── app-icon.png        # Your app icon
│   └── screenshots/        # Your app screenshots
├── src/app/
│   ├── layout.tsx          # Font setup
│   └── page.tsx            # Screenshot generator (single file)
├── package.json
└── ...
```

The entire generator is a **single `page.tsx` file**. Run the dev server, open the browser, review all requested locales on the same page, and click any screenshot to export it as a PNG.

## Export sizes

| Display | Resolution |
|---------|-----------|
| 6.9" | 1320 x 2868 |
| 6.5" | 1284 x 2778 |
| 6.3" | 1206 x 2622 |
| 6.1" | 1125 x 2436 |

Screenshots are designed at 1320x2868 (largest) and scaled down for smaller sizes.

## Tech stack

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Next.js | Dev server + static image serving |
| TypeScript | Type safety |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling |
| html-to-image | PNG export at exact resolutions |
| React | Component composition |

## Key design principles

- **Screenshots are ads, not docs** — each slide sells one idea
- **Copy follows the "one second" rule** — readable at thumbnail size in the App Store
- **Layouts vary** — no two adjacent slides share the same phone placement
- **Style is user-driven** — no hardcoded colors, gradients, or fonts
- **Localization is built in** — copy, fonts, and export naming must work for non-English locales like `zh-CN`
- **Metadata is constrained** — generated names, subtitles, promo text, descriptions, and keywords must fit Apple's current limits per locale

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- One of: bun, pnpm, yarn, or npm (detected automatically, bun preferred)
